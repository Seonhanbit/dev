=============== APPENDIX. Standard License Files ============== \n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
--------------- SECTION 1: Eclipse Public License, V1.0 -----------\n\
\n\
Eclipse Public License - v 1.0\n\
\n\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE\n\
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\n\
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\
1. DEFINITIONS\n\
\n\
"Contribution" means:\n\
\n\
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n\
    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\
\n\
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\
\n\
        i) changes to the Program, and\n\
\n\
        ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or\n\
        additions to the Program originate from and are distributed\n\
        by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'\n\
        from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such\n\
        Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\n\
        behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program\n\
        which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n\
        conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\n\
        and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\
\n\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\
\n\
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\n\
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\n\
or when combined with the Program.\n\
\n\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n\
Agreement.\n\
\n\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n\
including all Contributors.\n\
\n\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\
\n\
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n\
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n\
    license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\n\
    publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n\
    Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\n\
    object code form.\n\
\n\
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n\
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n\
    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n\
    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n\
    if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license\n\
    shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program\n\
    if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n\
    addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered\n\
    by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\n\
    other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per\n\
    se is licensed hereunder.\n\
\n\
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n\
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n\
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n\
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\n\
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\n\
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\n\
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\n\
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility\n\
    to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\n\
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow\n\
    Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility\n\
    to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\
\n\
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n\
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n\
    license set forth in this Agreement.\n\
\n\
3. REQUIREMENTS\n\
\n\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\n\
under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\
\n\
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
    b) its license agreement:\n\
\n\
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n\
        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n\
        warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n\
        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n\
        for a particular purpose;\n\
\n\
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n\
        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n\
        incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\
\n\
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n\
        are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other\n\
        party; and\n\
\n\
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from\n\
        such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n\
        reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n\
        software exchange.\n\
\n\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\
\n\
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n\
    the Program.  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright\n\
    notices contained within the Program.\n\
\n\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\n\
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\n\
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\
\n\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\
\n\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n\
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n\
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the\n\
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering\n\
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for\n\
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a\n\
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")\n\
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor\n\
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs\n\
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\n\
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to\n\
the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor\n\
in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n\
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any\n\
claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n\
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\n\
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\n\
and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\n\
the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n\
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\n\
claim at its own expense.\n\
\n\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n\
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n\
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,\n\
or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and\n\
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under\n\
this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims\n\
against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and\n\
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any\n\
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\
\n\
5. NO WARRANTY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED\n\
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n\
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR\n\
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A\n\
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining\n\
the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes\n\
all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement\n\
, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n\
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or\n\
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\
\n\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\n\
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\n\
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\n\
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\n\
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\n\
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION\n\
OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF\n\
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
7. GENERAL\n\
\n\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n\
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n\
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action\n\
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\n\
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\
\n\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including\n\
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\n\
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\n\
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n\
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n\
litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\n\
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement\n\
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after\n\
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under\n\
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution\n\
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's\n\
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\n\
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\
\n\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n\
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\n\
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves\n\
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement\n\
from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right\n\
to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement\n\
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve\n\
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version\n\
of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The\n\
Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to\n\
the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,\n\
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect\n\
to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new\n\
version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,\n\
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of\n\
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\n\
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\n\
under this Agreement are reserved.\n\
\n\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n\
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to\n\
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than\n\
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights\n\
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n\

asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such\n\
warranty or additional liability.\n\

\n\
3. Distribution Obligations.\n\
\n\
3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n\
\n\
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available\n\
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and\n\
that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this\n\
License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the\n\
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make\n\
available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in\n\
Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source\n\
Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used\n\
for software exchange.\n\
\n\
3.2. Modifications.\n\
\n\
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed\n\
by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your\n\
Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient\n\
rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\
\n\
3.3. Required Notices.\n\
\n\
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies\n\
You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may not remove or alter\n\
any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered\n\
Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving\n\
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\
\n\
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n\
\n\
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source\n\
Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License\n\
or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to\n\
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to\n\
one or more recipients of Covered Software.  However, you may do so only\n\
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\n\
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n\
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and\n\
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\n\
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor\n\
as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\
\n\
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\
\n\
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the\n\
terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,\n\
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are\n\
in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n\
Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights\n\
in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If\n\
You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different\n\
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n\
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer\n\
or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\n\
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer\n\
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\
\n\
3.6. Larger Works.\n\
\n\
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code\n\
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work\n\
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements\n\
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\
\n\
4. Versions of the License. \n\
\n\
4.1. New Versions.\n\
\n\
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish\n\
revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each\n\
version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided\n\
in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to\n\
modify this License.\n\
\n\
4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\
\n\
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered\n\
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under\n\
which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial\n\
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it\n\
from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent\n\
version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software\n\
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You\n\
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose\n\
to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available\n\
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\n\
the license steward.\n\
\n\
4.3. Modified Versions.\n\
\n\
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license\n\
for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of\n\
this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references\n\
to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license\n\
differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the\n\
license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\
\n\
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\
\n\
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,\n\
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n\
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF\n\
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE\n\
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE\n\
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n\
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST\n\
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\n\
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY\n\
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\
\n\
6. TERMINATION. \n\
\n\
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n\
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n\
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions\n\
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n\
this License shall survive.\n\
\n\
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory\n\
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the\n\
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is\n\
referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software\n\
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\n\
or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)\n\
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights\n\
granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\n\
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all\n\
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60\n\
days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically\n\
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such\n\
60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant\n\
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a\n\
written agreement with Participant.\n\
\n\
6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end\n\
user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor\n\
hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by\n\
any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\
\n\
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\
\n\
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\n\
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY\n\
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER\n\
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,\n\
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n\
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,\n\
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES\n\
OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY\n\
OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY\n\
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO\n\
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS\n\
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n\
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\
\n\
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\
\n\
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined\n\
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer\n\
software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ¤ 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and\n\
"commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in\n\
48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\n\
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End\n\
Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n\
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any\n\
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government\n\
rights in computer software under this License.\n\
\n\
9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\
\n\
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter\n\
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,\n\
such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n\
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction\n\
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to\n\
the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n\
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to\n\
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located\n\
in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within\n\
the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,\n\
including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'\n\
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n\
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any\n\
law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n\
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United\n\
States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and\n\
regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise\n\
make available any Covered Software.\n\
\n\
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\
\n\
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n\
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out\n\
of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work\n\
with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility\n\
on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to\n\
constitute any admission of liability.\n\

\n\

\n\
2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\
\n\
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\

\n\
2.7. Conditions\n\
\n\
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n\
\n\
3. Responsibilities\n\
\n\
3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\
\n\
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients rights in the Source Code Form.\n\
\n\
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\
\n\
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\
\n\
such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\
\n\
You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\
\n\
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\
\n\
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n\
\n\
3.4. Notices\n\
\n\
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\
\n\
3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\
\n\
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n\
\n\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\
\n\
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\
\n\
5. Termination\n\
\n\
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\
\n\
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\
\n\
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\
\n\
6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\
\n\
Covered Software is provided under this License on an as is basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n\
\n\
7. Limitation of Liability\n\
\n\
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such partys negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\
\n\
8. Litigation\n\
\n\
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a partys ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\
\n\
9. Miscellaneous\n\
\n\
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\
\n\
10. Versions of the License\n\
\n\
10.1. New Versions\n\
\n\
Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\
\n\
10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\
\n\
You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n\
\n\
10.3. Modified Versions\n\
\n\
If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n\
\n\
10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n\
